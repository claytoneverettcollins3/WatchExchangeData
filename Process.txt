Something that I saw on youtube
old.reddit.com/Watchexchange/top/year


Desired Data:
- Post title
    - What the item is (Brand, maybe model)
- Original Publisher (Submitter) first comment 
    - Price
    - Brand and model (compare to title to see which is better source)
    


Automated Web Browsing and Webscraping

    
1. Open old reddit and go to the WatchExchange subreddit. Sort by top this year.

2. Return the title of the first post. This is the second column. The first column will be the primary key (incrementing integer).

4. Click on the post and scrape for the top submitter comment. This will be column 3 in our dataframe.

5. Go back to the previous page and click on the next post and repeat until reaching the end of the page. I believe that there will be 25 items per page.

6. Click the next button to proceed to the next page and repeat the process.


Data Cleansing

1. Strip out the price from OPs original comment on the post.

2. Strip out the brand from either the post title or OPs original comment on the post. Hopefully I can obtain a list of models for a given brand and use that to search for key words in the post comment.

3. Strip out the model from OPs original comment on the post.

Scope: I may just do this for a list of brands that I am interested in (Rolex, Omega, Seiko (Grand Seiko))


Notes: I plan to ignore "collection" sales because I don't want to have to deal with the messiness. I need to figure out how to filter these out.
